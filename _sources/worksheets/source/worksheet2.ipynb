    "\n",
    "#### Case Study: Online Bookstore\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with designing a MongoDB database for an online bookstore. The bookstore sells books, and each book can have multiple authors. Customers can purchase books, and each purchase can contain multiple books. Additionally, customers can leave reviews for books they have purchased.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives:\n",
    "1. Design the data model for the online bookstore.\n",
    "2. Define the relationships between different entities.\n",
    "3. Create sample documents for each collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Entities and Relationships:**\n",
    "    - **Books**: Each book has a title, ISBN, publication date, and a list of authors.\n",
    "    - **Authors**: Each author has a name and a list of books they have written.\n",
    "    - **Customers**: Each customer has a name, email, and a list of purchases.\n",
    "    - **Purchases**: Each purchase has a date, customer reference, and a list of books purchased.\n",
    "    - **Reviews**: Each review has a rating, comment, customer reference, and book reference.\n",

    "### Exercise 3: Identifying and Modeling Relationships in MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case Study: Online Bookstore (Continued)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will identify one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships between entities in an online bookstore. You will analyze these entities to determine whether to embed or reference them using common guidelines. Finally, you will model these relationships using both embedded and referenced approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives:\n",
    "1. Identify one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships between entities.\n",
    "2. Analyze entities to determine whether to embed or reference using common guidelines.\n",
    "3. Model embedded and referenced one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Relationships:**\n",
    "    - **One-to-One**:\n",
    "        - Each customer has one profile.\n",
    "    - **One-to-Many**:\n",
    "        - Each book can have multiple reviews.\n",
    "        - Each customer can have multiple purchases.\n",
    "    - **Many-to-Many**:\n",
    "        - Each book can have multiple authors, and each author can write multiple books.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analyze Entities to Determine Embed or Reference:**\n",
    "    - **One-to-One**:\n",
    "        - **Customer and Profile**: Embed the profile within the customer document if the profile data is small and frequently accessed together with the customer data.\n",
    "    - **One-to-Many**:\n",
    "        - **Book and Reviews**: Embed reviews within the book document if the number of reviews is relatively small and they are frequently accessed together with the book data.\n",
    "        - **Customer and Purchases**: Reference purchases from the customer document if the number of purchases is large or if purchases are frequently accessed independently.\n",
    "    - **Many-to-Many**:\n",
    "        - **Books and Authors**: Use references to model the relationship since both books and authors are likely to be accessed independently and the relationship is many-to-many.\n",

    "### Exercise 4: Schema Design Patterns in MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case Study: Online Bookstore (Continued)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will explore advanced data modeling patterns in MongoDB, including the Inheritance Pattern, the Computed Pattern, the Approximation Pattern, the Extended Reference Pattern, and the Schema Versioning Pattern. You will apply these patterns to the online bookstore case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives:\n",
    "1. Understand and apply the Inheritance Pattern.\n",
    "2. Understand and apply the Computed Pattern.\n",
    "3. Understand and apply the Approximation Pattern.\n",
    "4. Understand and apply the Extended Reference Pattern.\n",
    "5. Understand and apply the Schema Versioning Pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Inheritance Pattern:**\n",
    "    - **Scenario**: The bookstore sells different types of books, such as eBooks and printed books. Each type of book has some common attributes (e.g., title, ISBN) and some specific attributes (e.g., file format for eBooks, weight for printed books).\n",
    "    - **Task**: Model the inheritance pattern for books.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```json\n",
    "    // Common Book Document\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"_id\": ObjectId,\n",
    "        \"title\": \"MongoDB Basics\",\n",
    "        \"ISBN\": \"1234567890\",\n",
    "        \"type\": \"eBook\" // or \"Printed\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // eBook Document\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"_id\": ObjectId,\n",
    "        \"book_id\": ObjectId(\"commonBookId\"),\n",
    "        \"file_format\": \"PDF\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Printed Book Document\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"_id\": ObjectId,\n",
    "        \"book_id\": ObjectId(\"commonBookId\"),\n",
    "        \"weight\": \"500g\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Computed Pattern:**\n",
    "    - **Scenario**: The bookstore wants to store the average rating of each book to avoid recalculating it every time a book is queried.\n",
    "    - **Task**: Model the computed pattern for storing the average rating of books.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```json\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"_id\": ObjectId,\n",
    "        \"title\": \"MongoDB Basics\",\n",
    "        \"ISBN\": \"1234567890\",\n",
    "        \"average_rating\": 4.5 // Computed field\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Approximation Pattern:**\n",
    "    - **Scenario**: The bookstore wants to store an approximate count of the number of times each book has been viewed.\n",
    "    - **Task**: Model the approximation pattern for storing the view count of books.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```json\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"_id\": ObjectId,\n",
    "        \"title\": \"MongoDB Basics\",\n",
    "        \"ISBN\": \"1234567890\",\n",
    "        \"view_count\": 1000 // Approximate count\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Extended Reference Pattern:**\n",
    "    - **Scenario**: The bookstore wants to store additional information about authors directly within the book document to avoid additional queries.\n",
    "    - **Task**: Model the extended reference pattern for storing author information within the book document.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```json\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"_id\": ObjectId,\n",
    "        \"title\": \"MongoDB Basics\",\n",
    "        \"ISBN\": \"1234567890\",\n",
    "        \"authors\": [\n",
    "            {\n",
    "                \"_id\": ObjectId(\"authorId1\"),\n",
    "                \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n",
    "                \"bio\": \"Author bio here\"\n",
    "            },\n",
    "            {\n",
    "                \"_id\": ObjectId(\"authorId2\"),\n",
    "                \"name\": \"Jane Smith\",\n",
    "                \"bio\": \"Author bio here\"\n",
    "            }\n",
    "        ]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **The Schema Versioning Pattern:**\n",
    "    - **Scenario**: The bookstore's schema for books has evolved over time, and you need to handle multiple versions of the schema.\n",
    "    - **Task**: Model the schema versioning pattern for handling different versions of the book schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```json\n",
    "    // Version 1\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"_id\": ObjectId,\n",
    "        \"title\": \"MongoDB Basics\",\n",
    "        \"ISBN\": \"1234567890\",\n",
    "        \"version\": 1\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Version 2\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"_id\": ObjectId,\n",
    "        \"title\": \"MongoDB Basics\",\n",
    "        \"ISBN\": \"1234567890\",\n",
    "        \"publication_date\": ISODate(\"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z\"),\n",
    "        \"version\": 2\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
