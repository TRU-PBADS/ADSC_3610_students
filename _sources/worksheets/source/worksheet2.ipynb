    "#### Case Study: Online Bookstore\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with designing a MongoDB database for an online bookstore. The bookstore sells books, and each book can have multiple authors. Customers can purchase books, and each purchase can contain multiple books. Additionally, customers can leave reviews for books they have purchased.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Design the data model for the online bookstore.\n",

We should reference the reviews id in the customer collection because the number of reviews could get quite large, hence referencing would be suitable here.
