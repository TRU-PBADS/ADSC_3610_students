    "   - **Correct Answer:** B) Relational databases use SQL for queries, while non-relational databases use various query languages.\n",
    "     - **Explanation:** Relational databases typically use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying data, whereas non-relational databases may use different query languages depending on their type (e.g., MongoDB uses a JSON-like query language).\n",
