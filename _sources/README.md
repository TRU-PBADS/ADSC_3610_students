This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of non-relational databases, with a focus on MongoDB as the main platform. We will cover data modeling, CRUD operations, and advanced querying techniques using MongoDB and its integration in Python via Pymongo. The course then transitions to PySpark, covering distributed data processing, DataFrames, Spark SQL, and machine learning applications. In the final section, the focus shifts to data governance, ethics, and security, addressing key topics such as data quality management, privacy, legal compliance, and the ethical implications of AI.
